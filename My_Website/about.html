            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Ever since I was just a wee lad, I've loved working with my hands.</p>
            <p>I am a Graphic and Industrial Designer with a Bachelor's degree from Concordia University. 
            I enjoy activities that let me spend time outdoors doing work with my hands. 
            I strive to always bring a positive, open-minded attitude to any and all projects 
            that I participate in. In my personal life, I like to practice a variety of sports 
            and organise multi-day nature outings. Professionally, I like to be stimulated by 
            what I do and enjoy learning about new topics to come up with solutions to problems.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Toronto and Montréal, I was exposed to art in a wide variety of mediums from a very young age. My prized posession as a kid was an easel that my parents gave me and they heartened me by displaying every dragon drawing I ever did.</p>
            <p>In high school, I was enrolled in a visual arts intensive program for 3 years but realised that at the time, I wasn't a fan of the strict format of the classes. As a result, I stopped making art and shifted focus towards mechanics. At 16, I got a job in a bike shop, where I worked for all of college, where I studied Liberal Arts.</p> 
            <p>After college, I chose to study Design at Concordia University. I made this decision because I see design as a confluence of art, practicality, and philosophy. I had also been watching a lot of Mythbusters reruns and loved the idea of working on such a wide variety of disciplines.</p>
            <p>In university, my love for design was confirmed and I learned to make sleek, practical objects. Now, I want to continue to bring that passion to my professional life.</p>
